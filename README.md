# sequence-driven-scms
Code for "Language Models as Causal Effect Generators" implementing sequence-driven structural causal models (SD-SCMs).

# causal data generation via language model

An SD-SCM allows for interventional and counterfactual data generation with a user-defined DAG and LLM-defined structural equations.

See `confounder_collider.ipynb` for example usage of the functions in `sdscm.py` to generate two SD-SCMs over the same set of variables (one with a confounder, another with a collider).

# benchmark for treatment effect estimation

The `data` folder contains 2000 example datasets for benchmarking treatment effect estimation algorithms (1000 from GPT-2, 1000 from Llama-3-8b) based on the following SD-SCM.

*This SD-SCM family is defined over 14 variables in order to explore the effect of a tumorâ€™s PD-L1 expression levels on different breast cancer therapy plans.*

The file `bcancer_generation.ipynb` demonstrates data generation using the breast cancer SD-SCM family. The notebook `benchmark.ipynb` replicates all effect estimation methods tested in the paper's example benchmark.
